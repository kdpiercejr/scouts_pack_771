# Purpose
Meeting to introduce people interested, to scouts.

**Date:** 8/29/2018

**Time:** 6:30 PM

# Notes
This was an awesome event.  As it stands now, there will be many new Scouts participating in Pack 771.

For the most part, this was an unstructured event.  Scheduled for 6:30 PM - 8:00 PM, families pretty much came and went until about 7:30 PM.  There was a rush at 6:30, but, for the most part, incoming traffic was fairly steady after that.

Representatives from Boy Scout Troops 437 (YMCA) and 70 (Saint Thomas).  RC had extensive talks about involving the Pack 771 AOL's with their Troops as a way of introducing them to Boy Scouts.

Eric and I talked about 2 Boy Scout events taking place that the AOLs and Webelos can participate in:
1. November 10th, 2018 campout at John Bryan State Park
1. Jan 12-13, 2019 campout at Marlie Lodge.

Information about both of these events will be passed along to Mike (Webelo) and Ken (AOL) and they can decide whether their Dens will participate.

Michelle, whom I didn't have as much opportunity to connect with, said 437 will have similar opportunities.

## Notes for next year
* The BSA website was down.  This was a significant issue in that people could not apply online.  In addition, on 8/29 and prior, the "Request more information" page for our Pack was unavailable.
  * Should some one follow up and provide feedback to the BSA?
* Suggestions for prior to "Join Scouts"
  * All Den Leaders should be present, if at all possible, to greet new prospective Scouts and their families
  * Pack should have a semi-polished communication strategy and process to what new families need to do
    * When Pack/Den meetings are
    * How to enroll
  * Having the Boy Scouts there was a godsend.  The did a wonderful job of entertaining the children and keeping them (moderately) organized
