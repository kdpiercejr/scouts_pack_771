## Veterans Flags; Evergreen Cemetery
I talked to Dave Smith.

The 7th is a Monday.  He suggested we do it on Saturday as the cemetery closes at 5 PM during the week.

There are two sections; general military and Civil War.  There are about 300 graves.  Additional graves are dispersed throughout the cemetery.  He said that historically, Scouts have focused on these 300 sites.

The cemetery has flags they will let us put out.

RC needs to follow up with KP to confirm dates.  With the date confirmed, I will reach back out to Dave and schedule.  At this moment, nothing is on the calendar that weekend.

## Fort Thomas Police Department
[Sergant Nathan Day](nday@ftthomas.org) is the night-shift duty manager.  They schedule 4 weeks out.  I e-mailed him our intent to come @ 7PM on November 5th.  He is in training until after 9/5/2018.  I will need to follow up with him around October 15th.  I have an entry on my calendar.

## Spook-o-ree

## Canoe Trip
September 8th, 2018

Loveland Canoe & Kayak Rental
Loveloand, OH 45140
(513) 683-4611
9AM - 6PM

### From web site
Castle trip; 2 - 4 hours to go 5 miles and passes the Loveland castle
* Another option is the 7 bridges which is a 4 - 6 hour trip over 10 miles...

Need to clarify; it says standard price is $48.00/canoe and 2 children 4 - 10 can ride free with parents...  Which would seem to infer that it's ~ $50 for up to 4 people (2 kids, 2 adults) in a canoe.

The group price for scouts is $18/person, which would be more expensive.  Is this supposed to be $18/canoe?

### 8/21/18 update
Closed due to high water.  Need to follow up at a later date (RC).
