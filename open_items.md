Verterans day is November 11th.

There are two sections; general military and Civil War.  There are about 300 graves.  Additional graves are dispersed throughout the cemetery.  Historically, Scouts have focused on these 300 sites.

## Canoe Trip
September 8th, 2018

Loveland Canoe & Kayak Rental
Loveloand, OH 45140
(513) 683-4611
9AM - 6PM

### From web site
Castle trip; 2 - 4 hours to go 5 miles and passes the Loveland castle
* Another option is the 7 bridges which is a 4 - 6 hour trip over 10 miles...

Need to clarify; it says standard price is $48.00/canoe and 2 children 4 - 10 can ride free with parents...  Which would seem to infer that it's ~ $50 for up to 4 people (2 kids, 2 adults) in a canoe.

The group price for scouts is $18/person, which would be more expensive.  Is this supposed to be $18/canoe?

### 8/21/18 update

* Ray to contact BC to see about discounts. - DONE
