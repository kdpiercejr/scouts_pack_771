# September 8th
* Canoe
  * Loveland canoe rentals
  
Loveland Canoe & Kayak Rental
Loveloand, OH 45140
(513) 683-4611
9AM - 6PM

Castle trip; 2 - 4 hours to go 5 miles and passes the Loveland castle
* Another option is the 7 bridges which is a 4 - 6 hour trip over 10 miles...

Need to clarify; it says standard price is $48.00/canoe and 2 children 4 - 10 can ride free with parents...  Which would seem to infer that it's ~ $50 for up to 4 people (2 kids, 2 adults) in a canoe.

The group price for scouts is $18/person, which would be more expensive.  Is this supposed to be $18/canoe?
