Upcoming Calendar Events:

I hope everyone has had a great summer. Now it's back to school and back to scouting. We will be having our Join Scouts Night on 8/29 at 6:30. We will be meeting with prospective families looking to join our pack. Please spread the word to anyone you think might be interested. It would be great if we could get as many of our existing scouts to attend as well. We will be having boy scouts from our neighboring troops attend to perform our flag ceremony and play some games with the kids while we answer any questions and assist new parents with sign up. 

Our next pack meeting is going to be on 9/4 at 7:00. This is coming up quickly and we are planning on going canoeing that coming weekend. Please be prepared to let us know if you would like to go by this pack meeting. We need to get with the canoe rental company by then to get our reservation in. If you can't attend the pack meeting and still want to go canoeing please let me know. 

Communication Strategy:

I want to make sure our families are aware of what we have going on. It has been my goal since taking over as cubmaster to improve in this area. We all understand that not everyone can attend every event, but I want every scout to have the opportunity to participate in everything we have to offer. The volunteer leaders including myself have come up with a number of ways to access this information. I'd like to thank everyone who has helped out. Hopefully this isn't overkill. We can adjust this as things go along. Any and all suggestions to improve are greatly appreciated.

* pack771.mypacksite.org - This is our new website. All info you should need about what we have going on is here. It works on Android and Apple devices as well as desktop/laptop. I just accessed it from Eli's school iPad, so the kids can have access to it if they want. You do not need to log into anything to view any of the info. There are also links to any scouting website you would need including cubscouttracker.com.

* Facebook - We will continue to use Facebook. We will post events coming up in the very near future and we all can share our photos of our scouting adventures. The official page is Cub Scout Pack 771.

* WhatsApp - This phone app is for secure / immediate communication. It offers us the ability to have a group chat between the whole pack or individual dens. Think of it as a chat walkie talkie. The primary function of this would be on outings or at events. Example: Your den is set to meet in 2 hours and it is a beautiful day out. The den leader may decide to meet at the park instead of at Moyer. He can communicate to his den with this app. I hope this happens a lot.

* Email chain - We will continue to send out emails with upcoming events or updates. The newsletter will be sent out in the email chain.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions. I look forward to this coming year. Please share this info with anyone that you feel needs it and my not be in this email chain.

Thanks,
KP
Cubmaster Pack 771
